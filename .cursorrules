SwiftUIProject structure:
All code is placed in the "MyZunderApp" folder. This folder includes all main files, "Views", "Shared" for reusable components and modifiers. It includes "Models" for data models, "Services" with "Network" for networking and "Persistence" for data storage, and "Utils" for extensions, constants, and helpers. The "Resources" folder holds "Assets" for images and colors, "Localization" for localized strings, and "Fonts" for custom fonts. Lastly, the "Tests" folder includes "UnitTests" for unit testing and "UITests" for UI testing.

GENERAL RULES:
- your descriptions should be short and concise.
- don't remove any comments.

SWIFTUI DESIGN RULES:
- Use Built-in Components: Utilize SwiftUI's native UI elements like List, NavigationView, TabView, and SF Symbols for a polished, iOS-consistent look.
- Master Layout Tools: Employ VStack, HStack, ZStack, Spacer, and Padding for responsive designs; use LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid for grids; GeometryReader for dynamic layouts.
- Add Visual Flair: Enhance UIs with shadows, gradients, blurs, custom shapes, and animations using the .animation() modifier for smooth transitions.
Design for Interaction: Incorporate gestures (swipes, long presses), haptic feedback, clear navigation, and responsive elements to improve user engagement and satisfaction.
